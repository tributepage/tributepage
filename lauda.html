	  <p class="about-niki">Andreas Nikolaus "Niki" Lauda was born 22nd February 1949 in Vienna, Austria to a wealthy industrialist family. Is an <a href="https://www.formula1.com/" target="_blank">Formula One</a> driver and a three-time F1 World Drivers' Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984.</p> 
	  <p class="about-niki">After a serious accident at the Nurburgring, where his car flew off the track, hit the barrage and caught fire, and Lauda's life was in grave danger, Niki only six weeks back in the race.</p>
	  <p class="about-niki">He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both <a href="http://formula1.ferrari.com/en/" target="_blank">Ferrari</a> and <a href="http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/" target="_blank">McLaren</a>, the sport's two most successful constructors. Currently working as a pundit for German TV during Grand Prix weekends and acts as non-executive chairman of the <a href="https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/en/mercedes-amg-f1/" target="_blank">Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team</a>.</p>

	      		<p>Nicky's family did not share his enthusiasm for motor sport and refused to give him financial support. Realizing that something needs to be changed dramatically, Lauda took a big loan from the bank and was able to buy himself a place in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_Engineering" target="_blank">March</a> team, which played in Formula 2, for the 1971 season.</p>
	      		<p>After successful performances in <a href="http://www.fia.com/formula-2" target="_blank">Formula-2</a>, Nicky's talent was noticed by the owner of the team Robin Hurd, and Lauda was invited to perform also in Formula-1 (the team played in two series at once).</p>

      			<p>Lauda's talent came true only when his team-mate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Regazzoni" target="_blank">Clay Regazzoni</a> moved to the Ferrari team in 1974, and its owner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Ferrari" target="_blank">Enzo Ferrari</a>, asked him what he thought of Niki Lauda. Regazzoni spoke positively, and Ferrari signed a contract with Lauda for the 1974 season.</p>
      			<p>The confidence that the team showed to the not-so-famous Niki Lauda became quickly justified - already in his debut race for Ferrari, Argentina's Grand Prix, Lauda took second place. The first victory in Formula-1, which was also the first for Ferrari since 1972, was won by him only three races, at the Spanish Grand Prix. However, although Lauda attracted universal attention in the 1974 season, winning in particular eight poles (six of them in a row), lack of experience and insufficient reliability of Ferrari cars led to the fact that he was able to win only once, at the Grand Prix Netherlands, and by the end of the season he took the fourth place in the championship.</p>
